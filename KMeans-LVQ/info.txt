"For Kmeans"

	Every time you run the main code, the dispersion value is saved in the file "Dispersion_Values"
	I already run the main code for each cluster 2,3,4,5,6,7,10 so i already have 7 values in my file.

	If you want to run your own tests (with your desired value of clusters), simply delete the "Dispersion_Values.txt" file 
					and the main code is going to create it, once you run it.

--- how to run the MATLAB scripts --- :

open dispersion_plot.m (uses the file Dispersion_Values.txt) and simply run the code to visualize the results.
open kmeans_plot.m (uses the KMeans_Centers.txt and KMeans_Clusters.txt) and simply run the code to visualize the results.

open lvq_plot.m (uses the LVQ_Centers.txt and LVQ_Clusters.txt) and simply run the code to visualize the results.
