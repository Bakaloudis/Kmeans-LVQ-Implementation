"For Kmeans"

Every time you run the main code, the dispersion value is saved in the file "Dispersion_Values"
I already run the main code for each cluster 2,3,4,5,6,7,10 so i already have 7 values in my file.

If you want to run your own tests (with your desired value of clusters), simply delete the "Dispersion_Values.txt" file 
			        and the main code is going to create it, once you run it.
