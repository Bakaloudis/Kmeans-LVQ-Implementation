# Kmeans-LVQ-Implementation
This eclipse project is about implementing the Kmeans-LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization) algorithm to a series of data. The data are in form of 2D vectors (S2.txt).
I also provide some scripts in MATLAB for vizualizing the clustering, for both LVQ and Kmeans, and the dispersion values.
You can change the value M for the desired number of clusters in both Kmeans and LVQ.
